    Generic Approach (T: FlyBehavior):
    Uses static dispatch (compile-time). The compiler generates a separate version of the method
    for each type T that you use with the method.
    Results in faster execution since thereâ€™s no runtime overhead for dispatching calls.
    Requires knowing the concrete type of fly at compile time.

    Trait Object (Box<dyn FlyBehavior>):

    using a vtable (virtual method table).
    Adds a slight runtime overhead due to dynamic dispatch.
    Allows more flexibility because the concrete type of fly does not need to be known at compile time.
